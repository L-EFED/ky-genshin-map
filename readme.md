Perform bug analysis and English comment translation for the following components:

1. ActiveMarkerLayer (Active Marker Layer)
Purpose: Displays the currently selected marker and its detailed information.

Load and render the designated marker icon (active-marker.png)

Show marker title, content, images, etc.

Support toggling "Incomplete / Completed" status (using Valtio for state management)

2. AreaItemLayer (Area Item Layer)
Purpose: Displays all resource points or special locations on the map.

Requirements:

Render markers by region type and whether they are aboveground/underground

Use MarkerLayer to show points, with support for icons and underground tags

Optionally exclude the currently active marker and completed markers

3. AreaNamesLayer (Area Name Layer)

I have been working on the first three parts of [components] and [drawer]. In [components], it implements a graphical toggle switch, which is commonly used to switch between two states, such as turning on or off a certain feature. The functionality of [drawer][area-item-types.tsx] is that they are used to render and manage a list of area item types. These components are typically used to build user interfaces where users can view and select different types of area items. [area-items.tsx] allows users to activate or deactivate an entire group of area items by clicking. It provides visual feedback, indicating the activation status of the area items through changes in background and text color. It displays the name and quantity of the area items to help users identify and manage different area items. [index.tsx] provides a collapsible sidebar that users can control the display status of by clicking a toggle button. The sidebar can contain various content, such as a list of area item types, from which users can make selections and perform operations.

### 1. **index.ts**
This code implements a visualization component for the _Genshin Impact_ game map, using CanvasKit for efficient map rendering.
- **Map Container**: Uses `CanvaskitMap` as the map container.
- **Tile Loading**: Loads and displays map tiles using `TileLayer`.
- **Interaction**: Supports panning and zooming interactions.
- **Layered Rendering System**: 
  - **Architecture**: Uses a layered architecture where different elements are placed on different layers.
  - **Order Control**: Controls the display order of layers using `zIndex`.
- **Dynamic Content Management**:
  - **Data and Configuration**: Retrieves map data and settings from the global state `store`.
  - **Dynamic Rendering**: Dynamically renders active area items.

### 2. **mask-layer.ts**
This code implements a black semi-transparent mask layer, primarily used to create a visual mask effect on the map.
- **Mask Effect Implementation**: Creates a black semi-transparent rectangle that covers the entire map area.
- **Layer Management**:
  - **Inheritance**: Inherits from the base `Layer` class.
  - **Z-index Setting**: Sets the `zIndex` to `underground` to ensure it is displayed above the base map but below other content layers.

### 3. **settings.tsx**
This code defines a React component called `Settings`, which creates a settings panel that allows users to control the visibility of certain features using switches.
- **Settings Panel**:
  - **Layered Map**: Controls whether the layered map feature is enabled.
  - **Teleport Points**: Controls the visibility of teleport points.
  - **Markers**: Controls the visibility of marked content.
- **Usage**: This component is likely used in a map application or similar application to allow users to customize the content displayed on the map.

### 4. **shadow-layer.ts**
This code defines a custom shadow layer and encapsulates it as a React component (`ShadowLayer`).
- **Gradient Shadow Effect**: Used to draw a gradient shadow effect on the map.

### Explanation of `state.ts` to `underground-layer.tsx`

#### **`state.ts`**  
This code implements the core state management and interaction functionality for an interactive map application. Its main purposes are:  

1. **Global State Management**  
   *Purpose*: Uses Valtio to create reactive global states, managing map instances, view states, and user data.  

2. **Map Event Handling**  
   *Purpose*: Processes map load events and click interactions, maintaining map instances and interaction states.  

3. **Marker Management System**  
   *Purpose*: Implements marker bookmarking/unbookmarking with `localStorage` for persistent user data storage.  

4. **Data Import/Export**  
   *Purpose*: Provides JSON export/import functionality for user marker data.  

5. **Underground Map Linkage**  
   *Purpose*: Automatically switches to the corresponding underground map when clicking a marker with underground layer data.  

6. **View Controls**  
   *Purpose*: Controls the visibility of underground layers, teleport points, and other map elements.

#### **`underground-layer.tsx` & Related Components**  
These two files together form the core visualization components of a game map system, implementing the following features:  

1. **Multi-Layered Map Rendering System**  
   - `TeleportLayer`: Handles surface teleport points (including special "Statue of The Seven" markers).  
   - `UndergroundLayer`: Manages hierarchical structures of underground maps.  
   - Seamless switching between surface and underground maps (via `undergroundEnabled` state).  

2. **Smart Display Control**  
   - Progressive loading based on zoom level (`zoomLevel`):  
     - Statues of The Seven hide when `zoom < -4`.  
     - Regular teleport points hide when `zoom < -2`.  
     - Underground map labels hide when `zoom < -2` and inactive.  
   - Visual emphasis mechanisms:  
     - Currently selected underground maps (`current`) are highlighted (`zIndex + 1`).  
     - Inactive underground layers are semi-transparent (`opacity: 0.3`).  

3. **Interactive Map Marker System**  
   - Categorizes different teleport types (Statues of The Seven vs. regular teleporters).  
   - Click interactions for underground map labels (switching active layers).  
   - Dynamic state management (via Valtio‚Äôs `useSnapshot` for reactivity).  

4. **Performance Optimization**  
   - Uses `useMemo` to cache map chunks and label rendering.  
   - On-demand rendering (controlled by `teleportVisible`).  
   - Virtual DOM layer management (via `DomLayer`).  

5. **Visual Hierarchy Management**  
   - Precise `zIndex` control (base layer: `zIndex.underground`).  
   - `MaskLayer` for smooth transitions during map switching.  
   - Responsive styling (dynamic CSS classes via `classNames`).  

---

### **Typical Workflow**  
1. When the user zooms, the system automatically adjusts visible content.  
2. Clicking a teleport activates the linked underground map (via `activateMarker`).  
3. Underground maps display hierarchical labels, clickable for layer switching.  
4. The system automatically handles:  
   - Visibility based on zoom level.  
   - Highlighting of active layers.  
   - Visual de-emphasis of inactive layers.

### **Technical Architecture**  
```mermaid

    A[State Management] --> B[TeleportLayer]
    A --> C[UndergroundLayer]
    B --> D[AreaItemLayer]
    C --> E[UndergroundMapItem]
    E --> F[ImageLayer]
    E --> G[DomLayer]
    F --> H[Dynamic zIndex Control]
    G --> I[Interactive Label System]
```

These components collectively build a **professional-grade game map system** optimized for performance and user experience, particularly suited for complex spatial data visualization in open-world games.

The explanation of area-picker.tsx
Load and display the marker icon (image)
Render the currently activated marker (activeMarker) on the map through <MarkerLayer>.
Display pop-up window (MarkerInfo)
When there is an activation marker point, a pop-up window is displayed to show its title, content, image (if any), and may provide a "Completed/Unfinished" button.
Support marking state switching (mark/unmark)
Allow users to click the button to set the marker point as "Completed" or "Unfinished", and use valtio status management.
Hide the button based on the condition
For certain special areas (in the borderlessNames list) or marker points with a refresh time not being 0, the marker button is not displayed.

The explanation of index.tsx
Initialize and render the Main application interface, which includes the GenshinMap, AreaPicker, and Drawer.
Display the splash screen before the map data is loaded.
Listen for the right-click menu and click events, and automatically close the pop-up UI (such as closing the selector and drawer when clicking on the map).
Use valtio to obtain the responsive global state store.
